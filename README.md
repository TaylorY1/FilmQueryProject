# FilmQueryProject

## Description

This project allows users to search through a database that mimics a video store database. It contains Actors and Films along with all of the pertinent information for each of those Actors and Films along with rental price, release year, language ID, overall length of movie, what special features it has, rating and rental duration. This database also contains a first name, last name and an ID for every actor in the database. This program is designed to search through each individual table and return what exact information you are looking for.

When you open and then run this project, you are immediately greeted with a menu as seen below:

---------------------------------------------
--------------------MENU---------------------
---------------------------------------------
Please pick from the following menu options:
1. Look up film by ID
2. Look up film by search keyword
3. Exit the Application
---------------------------------------------
Please select an option:


This will ask you select between three different options. If you select "Look up film by ID", you will then be prompted to enter any ID:

 "Enter keyword to search films:"

  If it corresponds to a film, the film that matches that ID will be displayed along with title, description, year, rating, language and cast will be displayed. If no corresponding film was found, a message saying no results are found:

  "There were no results found for that ID."

  If you select option 2, you will be met with this menu:

  "Enter keyword to search films:"

  This allows you to enter any keyword that may correspond to anything in the title or description that matches your keyword. This will display the film information. If nothing matched your search, you will be shown an error message:

  "That search returned no results."

  The original menu will continue to be displayed until option 3 is selected. Then you will be shown the message "Bye!" and the program will exit.


### Lessons Learned

For this project I learned an incredible amount about using Java Database Connectivity and sqltext in order to sort through databases fields to display the correct information that you want. This project really helped solidify my knowledge in performing queries, connecting to databases and using the correct syntax to perform the functions that I am trying to perform. This project also helped me quite a bit with solidifying my overall knowledge of Java. During the last couple weeks doing OCA preparation I really felt like I learned quite a lot about how to use the Java syntax correctly and what can work where. When writing this project in code, it was incredibly easier to perform the functions that I was looking for and this may the first time I fully felt like I could use the full functionality of Java. Learning all of the rules of Java during OCA prep really helped me with my logic of the code because now I know a lot of the capacity of what can be done where.

### Technologies Used

The Technologies used in this project were substantial. For this project I used a Macbook Pro with the Eclipse IDE to write all of the Java code. The other things that were used were MAMP, sqltext, Terminal, Atom, Zoom, Discord and Slack for communication. Additional Technologies that were used within the Eclipse IDE using Java were implementation of interfaces, multiple methods that perform different things, imports, Drivers and prepared statements to prevent any sort of sql injection.

### What was fun?

There were many fun things about this project. I was able to pull information from a database and allow a user to see that information using the command line. This was a very cool thing to be able to do within Java. This project really helped me see how Java can be fully incorporated into real life application and how useful it can be in so many ways. What else was fun is that I was able to use things that I have recently learned in full effect like using sqltext to find information in the correct way.
